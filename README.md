# NetCloud-Failover-Reporter

## Summary
Reports all failover events that have occurred on a given instance of 
NetCloud since the start of the month and outputs the records to an Excel 
sheet.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub 
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why
Provides insight to failover events that occur for systems using NetCloud 
to monitor their network system(s).

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.9.2
- configparser >= 5.0.2
- openpyxl >= 3.0.6
- pandas >= 1.2.2
- pytz >= 2021.1
- requests >= 2.25.1
- time-uuid >= 0.2.0

## Usage
- Clearly define what a "relevant failover" is and use the commented 
  variables and "if" statement to filter out irrelevant failover records.
  
- Edit the config.ini file with relevant NetCloud API information, the 
  timezone the devices on NetCloud are in, the desired column names in the 
  output Excel file, and the name of the output Excel file.
  - _Make sure you request relevant information to place in your Excel 
    columns. Available router information you can extract is here under 
    "routers" -> "routers Endpoint Fields and Filters":
    https://developer.cradlepoint.com/#!/Routers_
    
- Simply run the script using Python:
`python NetCloud-Failover-Reporter.py`
    
## Compatibility
Should be able to run on any machine with a Python interpreter. This script 
was only tested on a Windows machine running Python 3.9.2.
