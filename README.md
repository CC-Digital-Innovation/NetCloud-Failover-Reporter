# NetCloud-Failover-Reporter

## Summary
Reports all failover events that have occurred on a given instance of 
NetCloud since the start of the month and outputs the records to an 
Excel sheet.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub 
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why
Provides insight to failover events that occur for systems using 
NetCloud to monitor their network system(s).

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.9
- configparser >= 5.2.0
- openpyxl >= 3.0.9
- pandas >= 1.4.1
- pytz >= 2021.3
- requests >= 2.27.1
- time-uuid >= 0.2.0

## Usage
- Define which failovers you'd like to track. If you want to track all 
  failovers, make sure to disable the timeframe feature in the config 
  file. If you'd like to specify the days of the week and timeframes 
  per specified day of the week, enable the timeframe feature.
  
- Edit the config file with relevant NetCloud API information, the
  timeframe feature information, the timezone the devices on NetCloud 
  are in, and the name of the output Excel file.
    
- Simply run the script using Python:
`python NetCloud-Failover-Reporter.py`
    
## Compatibility
Should be able to run on any machine with a Python interpreter. This 
script was only tested on a Windows machine running Python 3.9.
