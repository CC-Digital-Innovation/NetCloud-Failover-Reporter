# NetCloud-Failover-Reporter

## Summary
Reports all failover events that have occurred on a given instance of 
NetCloud since the start of the month and outputs the alerts to an 
Excel sheet. The failover events can be narrowed down to "timeframes"
which ideally would be production hours of the customer using this
script.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub 
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why
Provides insight to failover events that occur for systems using 
NetCloud to monitor their network system(s).

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.12
- loguru
- pandas
- python-dotenv
- pytz
- requests

## Usage
- Define which failovers you'd like to track. If you want to track all 
  failovers, make sure to disable the timeframe feature in the config 
  payload by placing an empty dictionary: {}. If you'd like to specify
  the days of the week and timeframes per specified day of the week,
  enter the data in the timeframes dictionary.

- Simply run the script using Python:
  `python netcloud_failover_reporter.py`
    
## Compatibility
Should be able to run on any machine with a Python interpreter. This 
script was only tested on a Windows machine running Python 3.12.2.
